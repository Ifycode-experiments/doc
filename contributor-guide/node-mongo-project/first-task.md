## First Task 📌

The task is simple. 

* Watch the 15 minutes long [How to build a CLI with Node.js](https://youtu.be/s2h28p4s-Xs) YouTube tutorial. 
* Code along. You don't have to build anything new, just follow the tutorial as it is. Have fun doing so.
* Push your code to github. Make sure to use code versioning to document your progress. **Please do not fork or clone this repo yet. Do the assignment in your own github account**.

😌 Fun fact: You don't even have to understand fully what the instructor was doing.

|So am I. We'll reach out to each other if any issue comes up while taking the tutorial. Just show interest by finishing & submitting the task as instructed.|
